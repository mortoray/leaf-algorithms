# Leaf and SDL

I'm trying to get graphics working in [Leaf](http://leaflang.org). I'm using [SDL](http://libsdl.org/) for this. 

## Progress

Well, I've got this window:

## Activity

I'll try to record the work I do in [my blog](https://mortoray.com) and on [my stream](https://www.twitch.tv/mortoray).

- [New Game: A quest for graphics (Leaf-SDL #1)](https://mortoray.com/2018/02/28/new-game-a-quest-for-graphics-leaf-sdl-1/)


## Libraries

To use this branch you'll need to install `SDL2`.  I've also installed the development headers so I can lookup functions, and eventually use [c2ffi](https://github.com/rpav/c2ffi) on it.

> apt-get install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev libsdl2-mixed-dev
